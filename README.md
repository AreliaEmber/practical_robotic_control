This is the README file, it's the first thing you should look at when opening this project.

As of right now the project is mostly empty. File structure implementation also didn't seem to work as well as planned, so here a few short tips:
- depending on what you're using to make your commits, it's possible that you won't be able to commit any empty folders
- that's ok for now, we can fill out a proper file structure as we go, since for the most part it won't be too difficult to shuffle things around if we decide that the initial structure isn't working.
